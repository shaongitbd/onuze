Reddit-like app with Django, DRF, Django Channels, and React is a great choice. Here’s a comprehensive plan covering architecture, features, security, and best practices.

1. Project Structure & Setup
Backend (Django + DRF + Channels)
Create a Django project: django-admin startproject reddit_clone
Create apps: users, posts, comments, votes, notifications
Install dependencies:
djangorestframework
channels
channels_redis (for production)
django-cors-headers
djoser or dj-rest-auth (for authentication)
django-guardian (for object-level permissions)
drf-yasg (for API docs)
django-environ (for environment variables)
django-axes (for brute-force protection)
django-ratelimit (for API rate limiting)
django-rest-passwordreset (for password reset)
django-allauth (for social auth, optional)
Frontend (React)
Create React app: npx create-react-app reddit-clone-frontend
Install dependencies:
axios (API calls)
redux / zustand (state management)
react-router-dom
socket.io-client or native WebSocket
jwt-decode (for token handling)
formik + yup (forms & validation)
react-query or swr (data fetching, optional)
helmet (security headers)
eslint + prettier (code quality)
2. Core Features
Authentication & Authorization
JWT Authentication (DRF SimpleJWT or djoser)
User registration, login, logout, password reset
Email verification
Roles: User, Moderator, Admin
Permissions: Object-level (e.g., only post owner can edit/delete)
Posts
CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
Subreddits (optional): Group posts by topics
Pagination: Cursor-based for performance
Comments
Nested comments (threaded)
CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete
Voting
Upvote/Downvote on posts and comments
Prevent multiple votes per user
Real-time Updates (Django Channels)
Live post/comment updates
Live vote counts
Notifications (e.g., new comment on your post)
3. Security Best Practices
Backend
HTTPS: Enforce HTTPS everywhere (use SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT)
CORS: Restrict origins with django-cors-headers
CSRF Protection: Use DRF’s CSRF protection for session auth; for JWT, use HttpOnly cookies
Rate Limiting: Protect APIs with django-ratelimit
Brute-force Protection: Use django-axes
Password Hashing: Use Argon2 or PBKDF2
Input Validation: Use DRF serializers for all input
Output Escaping: Escape user-generated content (especially in comments/posts)
Object-level Permissions: Use django-guardian or custom permissions
Audit Logging: Log sensitive actions (login, password change, etc.)
Environment Variables: Store secrets in .env (never in code)
Database Security: Use least-privilege DB user, parameterized queries
WebSocket Security:
Authenticate users on connection (JWT or session)
Validate all incoming messages
Use secure WebSocket (wss://) in production
Frontend
Token Storage: Store JWT in HttpOnly cookies (not localStorage)
XSS Protection: Sanitize all user input/output (e.g., comments)
CSRF Protection: Send CSRF token with requests if using session auth
Helmet: Set security headers
Input Validation: Validate forms client-side and server-side
Error Handling: Don’t leak sensitive info in errors
4. Deployment & Operations
Use Docker for consistent environments
Reverse Proxy: Use Nginx or Caddy in front of Django
Static/Media Files: Serve via CDN or S3
Database: Use PostgreSQL (with SSL)
Redis: For Channels layer and caching
Monitoring: Sentry (errors), Prometheus/Grafana (metrics)
Backups: Automated DB and media backups
CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
Testing: 100% coverage for critical code (pytest, DRF test framework)
API Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI via drf-yasg

6. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Setup & Auth
Project scaffolding (Django, React)
User registration, login, JWT auth, email verification
Roles & permissions
Phase 2: Core Features
Posts CRUD
Comments (nested)
Voting system
Phase 3: Real-time
Integrate Django Channels
Live updates for posts, comments, votes
Phase 4: Security Hardening
Add all security middleware/settings
Rate limiting, brute-force protection
Audit logging
Phase 5: Frontend Polish
Responsive UI
Error handling, loading states
Accessibility
Phase 6: Deployment
Dockerize
Set up CI/CD
Deploy to cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
7. Extra Security Checklist
 All secrets in environment variables
 Secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
 CORS only allows frontend domain
 All API endpoints require authentication (except public ones)
 All user input validated and sanitized
 All output escaped
 Rate limiting on all endpoints
 WebSocket connections authenticated
 Regular dependency updates (watch for CVEs)
 Automated security scans (e.g., Snyk, Bandit)
